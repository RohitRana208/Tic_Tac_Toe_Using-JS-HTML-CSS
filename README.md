# Tic_Tac_Toe_Using-JS-HTML-CSS

This is a small Tic Tac Toe project that offers a valuable learning experience in JavaScript. I would like to express special thanks to Apna College and Shardha Khapra mam for their guidance. This project is entirely based on their video tutorial, providing a comprehensive understanding of the game. While there are various approaches to implement this project, I found this particular one to be effective.

This is the preview of this game
